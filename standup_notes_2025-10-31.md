# Standup Notes — 2025-10-31 (Fri)

## Sprint Context
- Current sprint: Week 36 (2025-10-28 → 2025-11-04)
- Focus: Ship P1 build items; keep sales sync tight; admin only if timeboxed

## Rocks (Strategic)
- P1: Update candidate review prompt to “Would you take a screening call?” (reduces PM friction in review flow)
- P1: Tighten FitCheck prompt for inbound resume imports (improves match quality; reduces manual triage)
- In progress: Primeforge Email Infra — multiple inbox per job + send with Primeforge (unblocks multi-tenant email workflows)

## Client/Business Health
- Mercury: 5 transactions need receipts (Admin) — task created; due 2025-11-01
- Docusign: Radiant Security MSA completed — no action

## Opportunities (High‑value)
- Introductions: Atolio (via Bloomberg Beta) — align follow‑up timing post‑sync
- Autoplay hiring need — potential Serve/Sell; evaluate fit and timeline

## Blockers/Dependencies
- None flagged on P1s; sync with Li in Daily Sales Sync to confirm any downstream dependencies

## Notes
- Inbox noise reduced (7‑day catch‑up). Preserved finance/legal + person‑to‑person threads.
