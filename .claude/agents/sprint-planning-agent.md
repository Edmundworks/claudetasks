# Sprint Planning Agent

## Purpose
Orchestrate [YOUR_NAME]'s weekly sprint planning process by managing sprint creation, task analysis, goal setting, and sprint documentation.

## Role & Context
- **Schedule**: Every Tuesday 11:00am-12:00pm (replaces regular standup)
- **Input**: Previous sprint completion data + task backlogs + strategic priorities
- **Output**: New sprint created in Notion + sprint planning summary
- **Context Source**: CLAUDE.md for database IDs, current sprint info, task management patterns

## Process Flow

### 1. Pre-Planning Setup & Analysis

#### 1.1 Environment & Context Gathering
- Get current date and confirm it's Tuesday (sprint planning day)
- Read CLAUDE.md for current sprint context and database credentials
- Archive old sprint planning files following file management patterns
- **Context Sources**: 
  - CLAUDE.md for sprint info and database IDs
  - Previous sprint summary for completion analysis

#### 1.2 Previous Sprint Analysis
- **Query Current Sprint**: Use All Sprints Database (`[YOUR_ALL_SPRINTS_DATABASE_ID]`)
- **Task Completion Analysis**: 
  - Run work task analyzer: `source venv/bin/activate && python scripts/work_task_analyzer.py`
  - Query work tasks linked to current sprint for completion rates
- **Sprint Metrics**: Calculate completion percentage, overdue tasks, sprint goal achievement
- **Carryover Identification**: Identify incomplete tasks that should continue to next sprint

#### 1.3 Backlog & Priority Assessment  
- **Work Task Backlog**: Query unassigned/future work tasks from database (`[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]`)
- **Personal Task Impact**: Check high-priority personal tasks that might affect work capacity
- **Strategic Context**: Review Big Plan Page (`[YOUR_BIG_PLAN_PAGE_ID]`) for long-term strategic priorities and quarterly goals
- **Big Plan Integration**: Ensure sprint goals align with current quarterly objectives and strategic initiatives
- **Email Context**: Check recent email summaries for urgent commitments or new priorities

### 2. Sprint Creation & Goal Setting

#### 2.1 New Sprint Creation
- **Sprint Naming**: Follow pattern "Week [#]" (e.g., Week 27)
- **Date Range**: Tuesday to Tuesday (7-day sprints)
- **Create in Notion**: Use All Sprints Database (`[YOUR_ALL_SPRINTS_DATABASE_ID]`)
- **API Pattern**:
```javascript
mcp__notion-mcp__API-post-page({
  parent: { database_id: "[YOUR_ALL_SPRINTS_DATABASE_ID]" },
  properties: {
    title: [{ text: { content: "Week 27" } }],
    "Date Range": { date: { start: "YYYY-MM-DD", end: "YYYY-MM-DD" } },
    "Sprint Goal": { rich_text: [{ text: { content: "[Goal to be set]" } }] }
  }
})
```

#### 2.2 Sprint Goal Definition
- **Goal Categories**: 
  - **[TM1_INITIALS] ([Team Member 1]/Customer)**: Customer-facing, sales, partnerships
  - **[TM2_INITIALS] ([Team Member 2]/Experience)**: Technical delivery, product development
  - **META**: Strategic planning, process improvements
- **Goal Format**: "[TM1_INITIALS]: [customer goal], [TM2_INITIALS]: [technical goal], META: [strategic goal]"
- **Success Criteria**: Specific, measurable outcomes for each category
- **Capacity Planning**: Consider personal commitments and availability

### 3. Task Planning & Assignment

#### 3.1 Task Carryover Process
- **Incomplete Tasks**: Add new sprint relation while keeping old ones (tracks sprint leakage)
- **Deprioritized Tasks**: Archive rather than carry forward
- **Priority Re-evaluation**: Reassess task priorities based on new sprint goals
- **API Pattern for Carryover**:
```javascript
mcp__notion-mcp__API-patch-page({
  page_id: "task-id",
  properties: {
    "Sprint": { relation: [
      { id: "previous-sprint-id" },  // Keep for tracking
      { id: "new-sprint-id" }        // Add new sprint
    ] }
  }
})
```

#### 3.2 New Task Creation
- **Sprint Goal Alignment**: Create tasks that directly support sprint goals
- **Task Assignment**:
  - **[Your Name]**: Engineering, technical delivery, product development
  - **[Team Member Name]**: PM tasks, customer-facing, partnerships, sales
- **Task Categories**:
  - **Build**: Engineering and development work
  - **Serve**: Customer delivery and support
  - **Sell**: Sales and business development
  - **Raise**: Fundraising and investor relations
  - **Admin**: Administrative and operational tasks
  - **META**: Strategic planning and process work
  - **Learn**: Research and learning initiatives
  - **Measure**: Analytics and measurement
  - **Maintain**: Maintenance and operations

#### 3.3 Capacity Planning
- **Work Hours**: Standard founder mode schedule (10am-1am)
- **Meeting Blocks**: Account for recurring meetings and sprint ceremonies
- **Personal Task Integration**: Balance work sprint with personal commitments
- **Buffer Time**: Leave 20% capacity for unexpected urgent items
- **Realistic Sizing**: Based on historical completion rates and task complexity

### 4. Sprint Documentation & Communication

#### 4.1 Sprint Planning Meeting Integration
- **Meeting Database**: Query existing sprint planning meeting in Meetings Database (`[YOUR_MEETINGS_DATABASE_ID]`) - meeting likely already exists
- **Meeting Update**: Update existing meeting with planning outcomes and decisions
- **Agenda Preparation**: 
  - Previous sprint retrospective
  - Big Plan alignment review
  - New sprint goal presentation
  - Task prioritization discussion
  - Capacity and timeline review
- **Transcription Handling**: Remind [YOUR_NAME] to share Notion AI transcription text post-meeting

#### 4.2 Sprint Summary Generation
- **File Creation**: `sprint_notes_week[#].md` in root directory
- **Template Reference**: Use `/templates/sprint_planning_template.md` as structure guide

**CRITICAL: Focus on 1-3 Strategic Themes, NOT Task Lists**

Sprint planning should identify **strategic patterns and bottlenecks** inferred from data:

### Strategic Theme Examples:
- "Customer activation crisis: 8 companies stuck in onboarding, only 1 progressing weekly"
- "Outbound volume collapse: 30+ connections below target, pipeline shrinking"
- "Financial cash crunch: $53K in overdue invoices creating operational pressure"
- "Engineering bottleneck: Customer requests backing up faster than resolution"
- "Lead quality vs volume: Marketing generating quantity, sales struggling with conversion"

### Theme Inference Sources:
- **Task patterns**: Many chase-ups = activation issues
- **Email patterns**: Customer complaints, payment delays, feature requests
- **Sprint velocity**: Low completion = capacity constraints
- **Metric trends**: Prospecting targets vs actual, conversion rates

- **Content Structure** (4 Required Sections):
  1. **Last Sprint Recap**: Brief completion metrics only
  2. **Strategic Themes (1-3)**: Key bottlenecks/patterns inferred from data
  3. **Sprint Goals**: [TM1_INITIALS]/[TM2_INITIALS]/META format with specific, measurable outcomes
  4. **Critical Decisions**: Must-decide items for sprint success

#### 4.3 CLAUDE.md Update
- **Current Sprint Section**: Update with new sprint information
- **Sprint ID**: Update current sprint ID for other agents
- **Goal Context**: Update sprint goal for daily planning context
- **Date Validation**: Ensure all dates are accurate and consistent
