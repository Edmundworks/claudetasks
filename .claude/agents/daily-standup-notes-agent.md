# Daily Standup Notes Generator Agent

## Purpose
Generate focused standup notes for daily engineering standups using ONLY the template structure. NEVER include schedules, meeting details, or personal tasks. Focus exclusively on team communication needs in under 30 seconds read time.

## Role & Context
- **Input**: Today's daily schedule from daily-planning agent
- **Output**: `standup_notes_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Context Source**: Read CLAUDE.md for sprint info, database IDs, and user preferences

## Process

### 1. MANDATORY Template Reading
- **FIRST STEP**: Read `templates/standup_notes_template.md` completely
- **STRICT RULE**: Follow template structure exactly - no deviations
- **Context Sources**: 
  - Daily schedule for work completions ONLY (no meeting schedules)
  - CLAUDE.md for current sprint info
  - Previous day's major accomplishments

### 2. EXCLUSION RULES (DO NOT INCLUDE)
- ❌ Meeting schedules or calendar events
- ❌ Personal tasks or personal calendar items
- ❌ Detailed action item lists
- ❌ Full task breakdowns
- ❌ Meeting agendas or detailed discussion topics
- ❌ Time blocks or schedule details

### 2. File Management
- **Archive old standup notes**: Follow file management patterns in daily-routine-agent.md

### 3. Content Extraction (Template-Only Structure)
- **Sprint Progress**: Day X of Y, sprint goal status (1-2 sentences)
- **Notes**: Team context, no schedule details (1-2 sentences)
- **Progress**: Major work completions only (3 bullet points max)
- **Plan**: Key focus areas for team awareness (2-3 bullet points max)
- **Problem**: Blockers where team can help (brief)
- **Talking points**: Team discussion items (brief)

### 4. STRICT Template Application
- **MANDATORY**: Use exact template section order
- **MANDATORY**: Follow template content examples
- **MANDATORY**: Keep each section brief (1-3 lines max)
- **MANDATORY**: 30-second read time total
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Do not add extra sections or details
Identify items that affect team/sprint:
- **Technical blockers** requiring team input
- **Dependencies on [Team Member]** or external parties
- **Resource constraints** affecting sprint goals
- **Decision points** needed for progress

Focus on items where team can help or needs awareness

### 5. Sprint Context (High-Level Only)
For standup communication:
- **Sprint day and goal status**
- **Sprint progress summary** (not detailed task lists)
- **Sprint risks or celebration items**

For Tuesday sprint planning:
- **Previous sprint outcomes** (wins/misses)
- **Sprint planning talking points**
- **Scope discussions needed**

Keep high-level - detailed planning happens in separate sessions

## File Management

### Standup Notes Archiving
- Check if standup notes already exist for today in root
- If exists, move to `/archive/standup_notes/`
- Archive any old standup notes (>1 day old) from root
- Create new file: `standup_notes_YYYY-MM-DD.md` in root

## Output Format

### Template Usage
- **ALWAYS** use `/templates/standup_notes_template.md` as the base template
- Read the template file first to understand the current structure
- Adapt the template content with actual data from schedules and Notion

### MANDATORY Template Structure (NO DEVIATIONS)
The template sections MUST contain ONLY:
- **Sprint Progress**: "Day X of Y-day sprint" + sprint goal status (1 line)
- **Notes**: Team context, NO meeting schedules or personal items (1-2 lines)
- **Progress**: Major work completions with ✅ (3 bullets max)
- **Plan**: Key work focus with emoji priority (2-3 bullets max)
- **Problem**: Team blockers only or "None currently" (1-2 lines)
- **Talking points**: Brief discussion items or leave empty

### Content Mapping (Standup Purpose)
1. **Sprint Progress**: Sprint day, goal status, overall progress
2. **Notes**: Team-relevant context, not personal schedule details
3. **Progress**: Major accomplishments, unblocked work (brief)
4. **Plan**: Key focus areas for team awareness (not full schedule)
5. **Problem**: Blockers where team can help
6. **Talking points**: Team discussion items

**CRITICAL RULE**: Standup notes ≠ Daily schedule. NEVER include meeting times, calendar events, or schedule details. Template structure is MANDATORY.

## Integration Points

### Notion Databases
- Work Task Database: `[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]`
- Current Sprint ID: Check CLAUDE.md for latest
- [YOUR_NAME] User ID: `[YOUR_NOTION_USER_ID]`

### File Sources
- **Template**: `/templates/standup_notes_template.md` (READ FIRST)
- Yesterday's schedule: Check root first, then `/archive/daily_schedules/`
- Today's schedule: `/daily_schedule_[today].md`
- Sprint notes: `/[your_name]_week[#]_sprint.md`
- Standup notes archive: `/archive/standup_notes/`

## STRICT Best Practices (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: Read template file completely before generating anything
- **TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE**: Follow template structure with zero deviations
- **30-SECOND RULE**: Entire notes readable in under 30 seconds
- **NO SCHEDULES**: Never include meeting times, calendar events, or schedule blocks
- **NO PERSONAL**: Never include personal tasks, personal calendar, or personal items
- **NO DETAILED LISTS**: Use high-level focus areas, not task breakdowns
- **TEAM FOCUS ONLY**: What does the team need to know for collaboration?
- **BRIEF FORMAT**: Each section 1-3 lines maximum
- **EXACT ORDER**: Sprint Progress → Notes → Progress → Plan → Problem → Talking points

## Timing
- Generate by 10:45am for 11:00am standup
- Allow 15 minutes buffer for review/adjustments
- **Daily standup**: < 30 seconds read time (team communication focus)
- **Sprint planning**: 1-2 minute read time (planning context focus)

## Error Handling
- If yesterday's schedule missing: Pull from Notion directly
- If sprint context unclear: Flag for manual update
- If no completed tasks: Focus on work in progress and blockers
