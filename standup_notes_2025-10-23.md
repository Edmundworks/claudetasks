# Standup Notes — 2025-10-23 (Thu)

## Sprint Context (Week 35)
- Theme: Pipeline pressure relief: clear onboarding backlog, activate partnerships, ship self-serve MVP
- Goals: Edmund — complete onboarding backlog (Andela notes, Radiant prep); Li — self-serve onboarding agent MVP; META — ATS discovery shortlist

## Rocks
- Customer onboarding quality bar (Andela, Radiant, Odynn)
  - Action: calibrated ML vs full‑stack criteria; enforce Rails/React/TS IC focus; schedule follow‑up review today
  - Risk: fake candidates; mitigation via multi‑source verification (GitHub + LinkedIn + email)
- Founder pipeline tooling (investor-intro matcher)
  - Action: send Loom to Ben E.; collect feedback; line up intros
  - Outcome: accelerate warm intro throughput for friendly founders; high leverage referrals

## Clients / Pipeline (Serve/Sell)
- Andela — 9 roles (Activating): follow‑up review today; ensure stack signal surfacing + reconfirmation step
- Radiant Security — 5 roles (Onboarding): align on hiring profile depth post-calibration
- Odynn — 4 roles (Onboarding): MSA completed (Docusign); proceed to kickoff tasks
- Kentron — (Onboarding): next touchpoint required
- Vitable, ourfirm, ignition, mako, Gravity, Uru — chase‑ups created (due 10/24)

## Opportunities
- Moshe (11:15): 30‑min intro; qualify fit and next action
- Founder Breakfast: high‑signal founder room; target 2 follow-ups max — protect deep work

## Technical / Product
- Voice agent calibration UX: add final spectrum check when inputs span disciplines (ML ↔ full‑stack)
- Candidate profile: surface core stack signals at top (Rails/React/TS)
- Anti‑spoofing: strengthen multi‑source checks; design quick “dog-name” sanity prompts for live screens

## Blockers / Requests
- Domain warming friction (Kamil): explore house‑domains to remove founder dependencies; decide go/no‑go today
- Personal calendar access currently unavailable via MCP — no impact to work schedule

## Today’s P0s
- Follow up with Kamil — decision + next steps (house domains if needed)
- Andela follow‑up review — confirm search quality; apply UX fixes
- Send Loom + intro suggestions to Ben Ellman; prep proactive list
