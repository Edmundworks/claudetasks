## Task Management Instructions

### Work Tasks (Database: `[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]`)

#### Adding a Work Task
```javascript
mcp__notion-mcp__API-post-page({
  parent: { database_id: "[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]" },
  properties: {
    title: [{ text: { content: "Task name" } }]
  }
})

// Then update with properties:
mcp__notion-mcp__API-patch-page({
  page_id: "new-task-id",
  properties: {
    "Tags": { multi_select: [{ name: "Build" }] },  // Options: Build, Serve, Sell, Raise, Admin, META, Learn, Measure, Maintain, Backlog
    "Person": { people: [{ id: "[YOUR_NOTION_USER_ID]" }] },  // [YOUR_NAME]'s ID
    "Sprint": { relation: [{ id: "[CURRENT_SPRINT_ID]" }] },  // Current sprint ID
    "Due Date": { date: { start: "YYYY-MM-DD" } }
  }
})
```

#### Marking Work Task as Done
```javascript
mcp__notion-mcp__API-patch-page({
  page_id: "task-id",
  properties: {
    "Checkbox": { checkbox: true }  // true = done, false = not done
  }
})
```

### Personal Tasks (Database: `[YOUR_PERSONAL_TASKS_DATABASE_ID]`)

#### Adding a Personal Task
```javascript
mcp__notion-mcp__API-post-page({
  parent: { database_id: "[YOUR_PERSONAL_TASKS_DATABASE_ID]" },
  properties: {
    title: [{ text: { content: "Task name" } }]
  }
})

// Then update with properties:
mcp__notion-mcp__API-patch-page({
  page_id: "new-task-id",
  properties: {
    "Priority": { select: { name: "High" } },  // Options: High, Medium, Low
    "Task type": { multi_select: [{ name: "ðŸ“‹ Admin" }] },  // Categories like Admin, Finance, Social, etc.
    "Status": { status: { name: "Not started" } },  // Options: Not started, In progress, Done
    "Due date": { date: { start: "YYYY-MM-DD" } },
    "Effort level": { select: { name: "Medium" } }  // Options: Low, Medium, High
  }
})
```

#### Marking Personal Task as Done
```javascript
mcp__notion-mcp__API-patch-page({
  page_id: "task-id",
  properties: {
    "Status": { status: { name: "Done" } }  // NOT "Checkbox" for personal tasks!
  }
})
```

### Key Differences
- **Work Tasks**: Use `Checkbox` property (true/false)
- **Personal Tasks**: Use `Status` property (Done/Not started/In progress)
- **Work Tasks**: Require Sprint relation and Tags
- **Personal Tasks**: Use Priority and Task type instead

### Task Tag Definitions
- **Raise**: Fundraising and investor-related tasks (e.g., Meeting with Asylum Ventures)
- **Serve**: Customer service and delivery tasks (e.g., Send new batch candidates to Resolvd)
- **Sell**: Sales and business development tasks
- **Build**: Engineering and development tasks
- **Admin**: Administrative tasks
- **META**: Meta/strategic planning tasks
- **Learn**: Learning and research tasks
- **Measure**: Analytics and measurement tasks
- **Maintain**: Maintenance and operations tasks
- **Backlog**: Tasks not assigned to any sprint, waiting to be prioritized

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Calendar Management**
   - Manage both work (`[WORK_EMAIL]`) and personal (`[PERSONAL_EMAIL]`) calendars
   - **CRITICAL RULE #1**: ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING CALENDAR EVENTS BEFORE SCHEDULING NEW ONES TO AVOID DUPLICATES
   - **CRITICAL RULE #2**: ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING CALENDAR EVENTS BEFORE SCHEDULING NEW ONES TO AVOID DUPLICATES
   - **CRITICAL RULE #3**: WHEN UPDATING LOCAL SCHEDULE FILES WITH NEW EVENTS, ALWAYS SYNC TO GOOGLE CALENDAR IMMEDIATELY
   - **CRITICAL RULE #4**: WHEN UPDATING LOCAL SCHEDULE FILES WITH NEW EVENTS, ALWAYS SYNC TO GOOGLE CALENDAR IMMEDIATELY
   - Create, update, and coordinate calendar events ONLY after checking for duplicates
   - Handle meeting scheduling and conflicts
   - **GTD Principle**: Only put hard appointments on calendar (meetings, events with specific times)
   - **DO NOT** create calendar blocks for quick tasks like "check email", "review documents", "HSA verification"
   - Quick tasks belong in task lists or daily schedules, not as calendar events

2. **Task Management**
   - Create tasks in appropriate Notion databases (work vs personal)
   - Work tasks: Use Work Task Database (`[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]`) with sprint/tag system
   - Personal tasks: Use Personal Tasks Database (`[YOUR_PERSONAL_TASKS_DATABASE_ID]`) with priority/category system
   - Update task statuses and priorities in both databases
   - Track deadlines and follow-ups across both work and personal contexts

3. **Daily Planning**
   - Use `.claude/commands/daily-routine.md` command for comprehensive daily routine (includes email triage, planning, and standup notes)
   - Individual planning: `.claude/commands/daily-planning.md` workflow for just daily schedules
   - Coordinate between calendar events and task priorities
   - Balance work and personal commitments
   - Follow GTD: Calendar for appointments, daily schedule for tasks

4. **Email Processing**
   - Systematic email triage and management across both work and personal accounts
   - Apply appropriate labels and archive noise to keep inbox focused
   - Forward important opportunities to relevant team members

## Important Implementation Notes

- **Sprint ID Format**: Always use dashes (e.g., `1234abcd-abcd-1234-ab12-abcd1234abcd`)
- **User Search**: Use `query_type: "user"` to find users
- **Database Selection**: 
  - Work tasks: Use `database_id: "[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]"`
  - Personal tasks: Use `database_id: "[YOUR_PERSONAL_TASKS_DATABASE_ID]"`
- **Array Properties**: Tags, Person, and Sprint must be JSON array strings (for work tasks)
- **Search Tips**: 
  - Use simple search queries without data_source_url
  - Search by user name and checkbox status for tasks
  - Fetch pages directly by ID when possible
- **Status Updates**: Always ask for user confirmation before making changes

## Task Management Instructions

### Task Workflow
- **Role Context**: [YOUR_NAME] is Programmer/Engineer ([TEAM_MEMBER_NAME] is PM)
- **Sprint Planning**: Every Tuesday (auto-created, no need to create manually)
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Auto-created, no need to create manually
- **Task Updates**: Archive/remove deprioritized tasks rather than keeping them incomplete
- **Sprint Summary Files**: May exist but often inaccurate - always use Notion as source of truth
- **Meeting Tasks**: Create separate meeting tasks when meetings are scheduled
- **Checkbox Format for API**: Use `{"checkbox": true/false}` not `"__YES__"/"__NO__"`
- **Quick Ad-hoc Tasks**: Immediately create tasks for ad-hoc requests during conversation
- **Priority Indicators**: P0 tasks are critical (e.g., deliverables for next-day meetings)
- **Sprint Carryover**: When moving tasks to current sprint, ADD the new sprint relation without removing old ones to track task leakage across sprints
- **Sprint Planning Transcripts**: Notion AI transcription blocks are not accessible via API - remind [YOUR_NAME] to share the transcript text during sprint planning
- **Task Assignment**: Assign engineering/technical tasks to [YOUR_NAME], PM/customer-facing tasks to [TEAM_MEMBER_NAME]
- **CRITICAL**: When marking tasks as done in Notion, ALWAYS update the local daily schedule file to reflect completion
- **CRITICAL**: When updating local copies (daily schedules, task lists), ALWAYS update the source of truth (Notion/Google Calendar) immediately to maintain consistency
- **CRITICAL SYNC PROTOCOL**: When ANY task status changes occur (completed, in progress, etc.):
  1. IMMEDIATELY update Notion database first
  2. IMMEDIATELY update the daily schedule markdown file second
  3. Check for any new calendar events needed
  4. Verify all three systems (Notion/Calendar/Local files) are synchronized
  - **NEVER** update only one system - always maintain full sync across all three

### File Management Rules
- **Sprint Summary Files**: Never create more than one file for the same sprint - always stick to the same file
- **Sprint File Naming**: Use format `[your_name]_week[#]_sprint.md` (e.g., user_week22_sprint.md)
- **Task Reorganization**: When reorganizing tasks, ONLY shuffle existing tasks from Notion - NEVER create new generic tasks like "Code review", "Documentation updates", "Sprint retrospective", etc.
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER create duplicate markdown files - always edit existing files. If asked to reorganize or update format, modify the existing file instead of creating a new one

## Personal Context

For detailed information about [YOUR_NAME]'s background, personal information, and context, refer to `profile.md`. This includes:
- Personal information and contacts
- Current company context ([Your Company])
- Schedule patterns and work hours

### Email Triage Process
1. **CRITICAL: Always exclude archived emails** from queries to prevent token explosions:
   - Use `-is:archived -label:[Email Client]/AI/AutoArchived` in all email queries to exclude archived emails and Superhuman auto-archived emails
2. **Quick Scan**: Review sender, subject, snippet only (avoid full body to save tokens)
3. **Critical Analysis**: Be skeptical of marketing disguised as opportunities
   - Check actual sender domain (not just names in content)
   - Look for mass mailing indicators (unsubscribe links, tracking URLs)
   - Don't get excited by big names in marketing content
4. **Auto-Archive Categories** (immediate archive):
   - **Recruiting emails** ([YOUR_NAME] is founder of AI recruiter company - ironic!)
   - **Calendar event confirmations/acceptances** (unless direct invite to [YOUR_NAME] or cancellations)
   - **Amazon orders/shipped** (only keep delivery confirmations - archive ordered/shipped)
   - **Google Voice notifications** (missed calls, voicemails - redundant with phone)
   - **Unsubscribe confirmations** (automated responses)
   - **Marketing campaigns** and unused product updates
   - **GitHub Actions notifications** (test runs, deployments)
   - **Routine [Bank] transaction notifications**
   - **Newsletters** (all newsletters including TLDR, Lenny's, Betaworks - content extracted to newsletter digest)
5. **Keep & Label**:
   - **Finance emails** (Finance label):
     - Tax documents, CPA communications, investment updates
     - [Investment Platform]/investment account issues, [Trading App] prospectus
     - [AI Company] account/usage updates, [Fintech Company] banking
     - **NEVER ARCHIVE**: Failed payments, password resets, account security alerts
   - **Bills** (Bills label + mark as IMPORTANT):
     - Utilities ([Utility Company]), credit cards ([Credit Card Company]), rent ([Rental Service])
     - Wire transfer confirmations, statement notifications
     - Failed payments and account alerts
   - **Deliveries** (Deliveries label):
     - **Amazon**: Only delivery confirmations (archive shipped/ordered)  
     - **Other retailers**: Keep shipped emails (likely no delivery notice)
   - **Legal/Investor/Customer/Vendor communications**: Always keep for manual review
6. **Newsletter Content Extraction** (for valuable newsletters):
   - Extract key insights with **source attribution**
   - Organize by category (AI/Tech, Business, Personal Development)
   - **Include source links** for traceability
   - **Focus on informational content** - avoid creating action items
7. **Credit Card Bill Processing**:
   - When found, create task in Personal Tasks Database ([YOUR_PERSONAL_TASKS_DATABASE_ID])
   - Set deadline = bill due date - 7 days
   - Include: bill amount, account ending digits, actual due date
   - Tag as "Admin" category with HIGH priority
   - Task title format: "Pay [Bank] Card â€¢â€¢â€¢[last 4] - Due [date]"
8. **Forward Important Items**: Send relevant opportunities to [TEAM_MEMBER_NAME] with context

### MCP Email Limitations
- No true "forward" function available - must manually craft forwarded emails
- Returns plain text versions (good for token efficiency)
- Can apply/remove labels, archive, mark read, create drafts, send replies

## Personal Assistant Workflow

### Daily Routine Integration
- **Automated Workflow**: Execute `.claude/commands/daily-routine.md` command file for full morning routine (NOT as an agent - run the command directly)
- **Profile Updates**: Use Task tool with `profile-updater` agent when [YOUR_NAME] shares information to remember
- **Ad-hoc Assistance**: Use context from this CLOUDE.md for direct help

### File Management Patterns
**Active Files (Root Directory - Today Only)**:
- `email_summaries_YYYY_MM_DD.md` - Email processing results  
- `newsletter_digest_YYYY_MM_DD.md` - Newsletter insights
- `daily_schedule_YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily schedule and tasks
- `standup_notes_YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Standup preparation

**Archive Structure**:
- `/archive/email_summaries/` - Historical email processing
- `/archive/newsletter_digests/` - Historical newsletter content
- `/archive/daily_schedules/` - Historical daily planning
- `/archive/standup_notes/` - Historical standup notes

### Context Sources for Direct Assistance
When helping with ad-hoc requests, always reference:
1. **Current sprint context** from this file's sprint information
2. **Recent email summaries** for urgent items and context
3. **Today's daily schedule** for task conflicts and availability  
4. **Database IDs and credentials** from this file for system operations

### Calendar Management Workflow
- **CRITICAL RULE #1-4**: ALWAYS check existing calendar events before scheduling
- Check both `[WORK_EMAIL]` and `[PERSONAL_EMAIL]` calendars
- **GTD Principle**: Only hard appointments on calendar, tasks in schedules
- **DO NOT** create calendar blocks for quick tasks
- **Calendar Awareness**: Verify all events before planning time blocks

### Task Analysis Scripts
- **Work tasks**: `scripts/work_task_analyzer.py` (requires venv activation)
- **Personal tasks**: `scripts/personal_task_analyzer.py` (requires venv activation)
- **Usage**: `source venv/bin/activate && python scripts/[script].py`

## Example Task Creation

```javascript
Notion:create-pages({
  pages: [{
    properties: {
      "Name": "Fix email classification bug",
      "Tags": "[\"Build\"]",
      "Person": "[\"[YOUR_NOTION_USER_ID]\"]",
      "Sprint": "[\"current-sprint-id\"]",
      "Checkbox": "__NO__",
      "date:Due Date:start": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "date:Due Date:is_datetime": 0
    }
  }],
  parent: { database_id: "[YOUR_WORK_TASK_DATABASE_ID]" }
})
```
