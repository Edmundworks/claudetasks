# Sales Call 1 Summary: Picogrid

## Meeting Details
- **Company**: Picogrid
- **Contact**: Dan Chirita (Co-founder & CTO)
- **Email**: dan@picogrid.com
- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Duration**: ~25 minutes
- **Granola URL**: https://notes.granola.ai/d/953cc59e-7977-44e8-8e7a-40aa58bd26dd

## Company Background
- Defense tech company (LA-based)
- ~40 people in company, ~25-26 in engineering/manufacturing
- Hardware + software company with field deployments
- High-stakes distributed systems with real-time constraints
- Dan leads all engineering (hardware, software, manufacturing, R&D, field ops)
- Originally led hardware department, took over all engineering 1.5 years ago from CEO (Zayn)

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Hiring Philosophy**: Extremely high bar - only "top top tier talent"
   - Former founders or uniquely talented individuals
   - "Superstars" and leaders in their fields
   - Some from "black projects" backgrounds (Skunkworks, Phantomworks)
2. **Current Recruiting**: Just hired first full-time technical recruiter (started today - Chanel Raph)
3. **Sourcing History**: 3 founders did most recruiting; 2-3 external hires out of ~40 came from agencies
4. **Unique Challenge**: Not simple keyword matching - need to "lurk Twitter and Reddit" to find these outliers

## Pain Points/Needs Expressed
1. **Niche Technical Requirements**:
   - Distributed systems designers (7-15 years experience)
   - Tech leads / IC track specialists
   - Federated data systems across multiple servers
   - Very few startups build this kind of system
2. **Cultural Fit Challenge**: Large company -> startup transition is difficult
   - Need people who understand or have experienced startup pace
   - Prior startup experience is strong signal
3. **Electrical Engineering**: Hardest to source (but close to closing one)
4. **High Volume**: Need to scale hiring, hence hired full-time recruiter

## Current Hiring Situation
- **Just hired**: First full-time technical recruiter (Chanel Raph) - started today
- **Working with**: 2 external recruiters
- **Priority Role**: Senior Distributed Systems Engineer (7-15 years)
- **Other Needs**: Hardware, software across the board
- Using Ashby as ATS

## Pricing Discussion
- Standard pricing presented: 10% + $500/month
- **No pushback whatsoever** - Dan said "sounds interesting"
- Asked about trial period - Edmund explained outcome-based model

## Next Steps/Action Items
1. **Follow-up call scheduled**: Thursday at 11am Pacific
   - Dan + Chanel Raph (new recruiter) to attend
   - Email: chanelraph@picogrid.com
2. Dan to brief Chanel on the call
3. Could explore Ashby integration for inbound filtering
4. Edmund mentioned hardware roles could also be explored

## Technical Interest
- Dan asked detailed questions about:
  - Response rate optimization
  - How outreach avoids appearing "agent-like"
  - Email vs LinkedIn effectiveness
  - Stage ownership in the funnel
- Appreciated the A/B testing and data-driven approach

## Overall Assessment
**HOT LEAD**

### Reasoning:
- Clear, immediate hiring needs (defense tech scaling fast)
- No pricing objections
- Decision maker on call (CTO/co-founder)
- Perfect timing: just hired recruiter who can own the tool
- Follow-up already scheduled for Thursday
- Validated unique value prop: finding "outlier" talent that can't be keyword-matched
- Defense sector = high salaries = good economics for success fee model

### Barriers:
- New recruiter just started today - may need time to ramp
- Dan wants recruiter buy-in before committing
- Electrical engineering needs may be outside current product scope

### Probability of Close: High (70-75%)
- Engaged throughout, asked smart technical questions
- Scheduled follow-up proactively
- Said "sounds interesting" and "worth trying"
- Good ICP fit: niche technical roles, high bar, startup culture focus

### Quote from Dan:
"It's not as simple as just punching your requirements into LinkedIn recruiter and SQL falls out... It's much more of a you got to kind of lurk Twitter and Reddit and find these blogs or YouTube channels"

### Additional Opportunity:
- Mentioned Ashby integration for inbound filtering
- Could expand to hardware roles if initial success
- Defense sector referrals (mentioned Flip as another defense customer)
