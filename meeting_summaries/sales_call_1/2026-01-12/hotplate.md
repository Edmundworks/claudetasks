- **Date**: 2026-01-12
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes

## Company Background
- YC company building in food tech - "Shopify for food drops"
- Back office platform for home chefs/food entrepreneurs
- Just crossed $75 million all-time paid out to chefs
- Super lean team
- Just rebuilt entire product (launching in Feb)
- Edmund has history with them - did manual recruiting for Hotplate before building Superposition
- Used Hotplate as example customer in Betaworks demo day presentation

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Historical Relationship**: Edmund did manual recruiting for Hotplate "back in the day" - this was part of the discovery that led to building Superposition
2. **Product Rebuild**: Spent 2024 rebuilding Hotplate from scratch with AI tooling - launching Feb 2025
3. **Demo Day Reference**: Edmund used "hire engineers who are foodies" as the example in Betaworks demo (real Hotplate input)
4. **Fun Connection**: Someone in Edmund's building in Bed-Stuy uses Hotplate for food drops

## Pain Points/Needs Expressed
1. **Immediate Timeline**: One engineer going on leave mid-Feb - need to backfill urgently
2. **Lean Process**: Want to run hiring super lean
   - Aggressive upfront filtering
   - Short process (30 min culture fit -> 30 min technical -> take home -> on-site)
3. **Ideal Candidate**: End-to-end autonomous engineers with startup experience, no manager hand-holding needed
4. **Volume Play**: Open to running multiple channels simultaneously

## Current Hiring Situation
- **Immediate Need**: 2 full-stack engineers (urgent - 6 week timeline ideal)
- **2025 Roadmap**: Head of Engineering, Infrastructure engineer, Designer
- Also talking to external sourcing agency (comparing channels)
- Using Ashby as ATS

## Pricing Discussion
- Standard pricing: 10% + $500/month
- Edmund offered: $500 for 2 roles (not per role) given relationship
- Tenaya had no objections
- Mentioned potential for "all you can eat" pricing at scale after next raise

## Next Steps/Action Items
1. **Tenaya to confirm with Ben (co-founder)** - expects answer within an hour
2. **Kickoff call to schedule**: Ben to lead voice agent onboarding (for technical calibration), Tenaya to contribute culture inputs
3. Ben currently sick with flu - may need to wait until Thursday for onboarding
4. Edmund to follow up if no response by Thursday

## Additional Product Interest
- Expressed interest in Superposition replacing Ashby (ATS)
- Edmund mentioned ATS functionality in design partner phase
- Could be future upsell opportunity

## Overall Assessment
**HOT LEAD - EXISTING RELATIONSHIP**

### Reasoning:
- Pre-existing relationship and trust ("I already have a lot of trust with you")
- Clear, urgent hiring needs with tight timeline (6 weeks)
- No pricing objections - accepted discount
- Both founders engaged
- Perfect product fit: they pioneered the "foodies" use case
- Willing to run multiple channels - not competitive evaluation

### Barriers:
- Ben (co-founder) currently sick with flu
- Comparing with external sourcing agency (but sees as complementary)

### Probability of Close: Very High (85-90%)
- Tenaya said "might as well try"
- Expected to confirm within an hour of call
- Historical relationship de-risks the decision
- Perfect ICP match

### Quote from Tenaya:
"I already have a lot of trust with you, so honestly, I'm like, might as well try."
