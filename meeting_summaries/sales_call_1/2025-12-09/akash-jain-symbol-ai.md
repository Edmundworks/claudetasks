## Key Discussion Points

### Prospect Background
- Symbol AI builds AI tooling for enterprise recruitment workflows (sourcing, interviewing, scheduling agents)
- Focus on high-volume frontline hiring (80% of US hiring market)
- Raised seed from Peter Thiel/Founders Fund, planning Series A soon
- Current engineering team: CTO (AI PhD), founding engineer, couple engineers

### Hiring Needs
1. **Founding Head of Engineering** (potential co-CTO path)
   - Full-stack focused, hands-on coding required
   - Build scalable applications (millions of calls/week)
   - Engineering management + leadership
   - Product collaboration with Akash

2. **Founding Engineer**
   - Hands-on coding daily
   - Fast turnaround on client work (same-day delivery capability)
   - Ship quickly without tech debt

### Why Not Dog-Fooding Their Product
- Their product focused on frontline high-volume recruiting, not technical/skills-based recruiting
- Wants expertise from specialist for foundational engineering hires
- Also wanted help identifying ideal profile (director vs senior, etc.)

### Competitor Experience
- **Noon AI**: Good product, but limited credits and pay-upfront model was issue for tight budgets
- **Paraform**: Using now, $500/mo + placement fee, but candidate quality not meeting bar (not at Founders Fund portfolio level)
- **JuiceBox**: Poor skills matching, can't give real-time feedback on candidates

### What Resonated
- Outcome-based pricing (10% vs traditional 20%)
- Real-time candidate feedback/calibration
- Voice-based intake for understanding requirements
- High-concept/philosophical matching (not just keywords)

## Objections & Concerns

- Wants to validate with team before committing
- Needs to see case studies of similar hires (American, early-stage VC-backed, hands-on engineers)
- Very picky about quality - these are engineer #2, #3 decisions

## Next Steps

| Action | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Send case studies and testimonials for similar hires | Edmund | Pending |
| Internal review with team | Akash | Pending |
| Schedule onboarding call if interested | Both | Pending |

## Deal Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Deal Stage** | Interest/Evaluation |
| **Fit Score** | High - exactly our ICP |
| **Urgency** | Medium - actively hiring |
| **Competition** | Paraform (currently using, unhappy with quality) |
| **Potential Value** | 2 hires x ~$150-200k salary x 10% = $30-40k |

## Notes

- Akash has excellent understanding of the recruiting AI space
- They discovered us through research on VC-backed startup engineering hires
- Strong signal: They're an AI recruiting company choosing to use an external solution for quality reasons
- Follow up with case studies featuring Founders Fund / similar tier portfolio companies
