## Company Overview

**Company:** Zenline (zenline.ch)
**Location:** Zurich, Switzerland
**Industry:** Tech startup

**Team Context:**
- Arber: Responsible for growth and operations, handling hiring manually
- Gerrit: Also on team, saw Superposition content on LinkedIn
- Have CEO and CTO who would need to be involved in hiring process

---

## Hiring Needs & Pain Points

### Current Roles
1. **Full Stack Deployed Engineer** (on-site in Zurich)
2. **Founding Engineer** - mix of full stack builder with product sensibilities

### Timeline & Volume
- Not urgent - open to summer 2026 timeframe
- Will need more people over the coming 3 years
- Currently sourcing in Europe generally

### Pain Points Identified
1. Manual process too time-consuming (tried Apollo, Flyr - still too manual)
2. Technical screening challenges - CEO/CTO requirements hard to translate
3. Keyword vs semantic search problem
4. Multiple stakeholder input needed (CEO, CTO, Arber)
5. Zurich "golden cage" - ETH grads earning €200k don't have hustle

---

## Edmund's Assessment of Fit

### Why NOT a Fit Right Now
- Product currently optimized for US only
- Zurich on-site requirement not supported
- Europe expansion planned for Q2 2026

### Why GOOD Fit for Future
- Perfect ICP: non-recruiter handling hiring
- Pain points align perfectly with product
- Strong product validation (voice, async multi-stakeholder, semantic search)
- Budget aligned (10% vs 20-25%)

---

## Next Steps

- Reconnect when Europe expansion ready (Q2 2026 expected)
- Future call will include Arber, Gerrit, CEO, and CTO
- Arber committed to seeing product again in summer 2026

### Referral Source
LinkedIn content (inbound from Gerrit seeing posts)
