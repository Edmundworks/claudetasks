## Company Background
- Mobile consumer women's health app (period tracker, pregnancy tracker)
- 2 million monthly active users
- Top 3 in their category alongside competitors
- Founded by Rachel (design background)
- Visible brand presence - Edmund saw their ad on top of a taxi in NYC
- Going through major restructuring with help from Tuba

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Referral Source**: Jordan from Betaworks recommended Superposition; also saw Julia Dixon case study on website
2. **Product Challenges**: Slowest product among competitors, team not moving efficiently, "half of them are not that great"
3. **Mission Alignment**: Historically struggled to find mission-aligned engineers due to women's health focus; market improving as more women enter CS
4. **Technical Gaps**: Rachel has design background - finds it hard to ascertain engineer quality or conduct technical interviews

## Pain Points/Needs Expressed
1. **CTO Search**: Looking for "amazing, visionary" engineering leadership who:
   - Knows how to use AI
   - Can scale company from 2M to 40M users
   - Is hands-on technical leader
2. **Team Quality Issues**: Current engineering team has performance problems
3. **Evaluation Challenge**: Rachel admits she's "very much like, I'll take what I can get" due to lack of technical evaluation expertise
4. **Mission Fit**: Need engineers who care about women's health mission

## Current Hiring Situation
- Have existing engineering team but need leadership
- Going through restructuring (with Tuba's help)
- Primary need: **CTO hire**
- Relevant context: Last 2 of 5 roles filled by Superposition were CTO roles

## Pricing Discussion
- Edmund presented standard pricing (10% + $500/month)
- Rachel said "Awesome" - no pushback
- Call cut short due to Rachel's childcare situation (nanny called in sick)

## Next Steps/Action Items
1. **Edmund to send**:
   - Julia Dixon CTO case study
   - Option to schedule follow-up call to actually use the voice agent
2. **Rachel requested**: Loom/video walkthrough OR another call to experience the product
3. Edmund suggested live demo with voice agent (better than Loom since it's voice-based)
4. Schedule follow-up call later in the week

## Overall Assessment
**HOT LEAD**

### Reasoning:
- Strong referrals (Betaworks investor Jordan + Julia Dixon case study)
- Clear, urgent need (CTO role - proven Superposition strength)
- Admits current situation is broken and needs help
- No pricing objections
- Decision maker on call (Rachel is founder)
- High-profile company with visible brand presence
- Good fit: CTO roles are exactly what agent excels at

### Barriers:
- Call was cut short (childcare emergency)
- Need to actually schedule the demo/voice agent session
- Tuba (fractional) may also be evaluating for her own company (potential additional opportunity)

### Probability of Close: High (70-80%)
- Perfect ICP match (founder-led, needs CTO, admitted evaluation challenges)
- Multiple referral sources build trust
- Expressed clear interest: "This is amazing"

### Additional Opportunity:
- Tuba mentioned she might be looking for a CTO for her own company
- Could be a secondary lead to follow up on
