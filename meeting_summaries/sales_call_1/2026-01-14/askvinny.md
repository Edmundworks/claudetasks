# Sales Call 1 Summary: AskVinny

## Meeting Details
- **Company**: AskVinny
- **Contact**: Ian Martin
- **Email**: ian@askvinny.co.uk
- **Date**: 2026-01-14
- **Duration**: ~20 minutes (scheduled 15 min)
- **Granola URL**: https://granola.ai/note/57df495d-bdf6-45f9-a802-2f5aba609479

## Company Background
- UK-based startup (Ian based near Aberdeen, Scotland)
- Fully remote company
- Grew from 2-3 people to 14 people in 2024
- Plans to scale team 3-4x in 2025 (most growth after Q1)
- Has a CTO named Rory Rose
- Most team currently on European time zones

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Referral Source**: Competitor (Jack and Jill) sent Ian a Superposition case study as an example of a good case study format - he decided to check out the product
2. **Recent Hiring Experience**: Used Jack and Jill for a solutions engineer hire - took 4 months internally, closed in 3 weeks with Jack and Jill
3. **Voice Intake Feedback**: Ian "absolutely hated" Jack and Jill's voice intake - found it clunky with too much latency and misunderstanding; preferred just dumping in job spec info

## Pain Points/Needs Expressed
1. Looking for alternative to traditional recruiters
2. Want access to better talent, faster
3. Want to stay more in control of the process
4. Hiring growth was "painful" in 2024
5. Need German-speaking talent for customer-facing roles

## Current Hiring Situation
- **Key Account Executive**: Native German speaker required, based in/near Germany for customer face time
- **Engineering roles**: Have 2 potential roles but may be covered through existing network (Rory has candidates in the pipeline)
- No active prospecting for engineering right now, but will need to hire in a couple months

## Geographic Limitation Discussion
- Superposition currently US-focused only
- Ian's immediate needs are Europe-based (German account exec)
- Edmund mentioned EU expansion planned for later in 2025
- Remote engineering roles could potentially work if US-based

## Pricing Discussion
- 10% success fee + $500/month per role
- Ian said pricing "works" and is "fine"
- No pushback on pricing model

## Next Steps/Action Items
1. **No immediate action** - geographic mismatch for current needs
2. Ian to keep Superposition in mind for US-based engineering roles
3. Edmund to notify Ian when EU expansion happens
4. Ian to reach out if any US hiring needs arise before EU launch

## Overall Assessment
**WARM LEAD (Future Opportunity)**

### Reasoning:
- Strong interest in the product and approach
- Validated pain points with current hiring
- No objection to pricing
- Good cultural fit (startup founder who gets it)
- Just geographic mismatch for immediate needs

### Barriers to Close:
- Primary need (German account exec) requires EU presence
- Engineering roles may be covered via existing network
- Superposition not yet available in EU market

### Probability of Close: Medium-Long Term (40-50%)
- Will likely convert once EU expansion happens
- Could convert sooner if US engineering needs emerge
- Ian expressed genuine interest: "I'll keep you in mind"

### Follow-up Timing:
- Check in when EU expansion launches
- Could reach out in ~2 months when engineering hiring picks up
