## Discussion Summary
Arthur Attal (co-founder), Dima (co-founder), and Adam (engineer) from Domos reconnected with Edmund after first speaking in summer 2025. They are an AI company themselves and had previous bad experiences with another AI recruiting tool that wanted AI to speak directly with prospects, which they hated. Edmund addressed this concern - Superposition's AI is only for onboarding/intake, not candidate screening.

The team wanted to experience the voice agent firsthand. Adam did a live demo of the onboarding process, talking to the voice agent to describe the ideal hire. They were impressed with the AI's natural modulation and conversational style. Technical discussion followed about the tech stack (11 Labs voice, GPT-4.5.1 for back-and-forth, Vapi for iteration).

Arthur explained their current situation: they almost filled a junior engineer role last week but the offer fell through. They're currently going through remaining candidates and will know in the next few days if they need additional help. They appreciated the outcome-based pricing model (10% fee vs traditional 20%+ retainers).

## Key Product Feedback
1. Voice AI demo was well-received - "it works, it's pretty slick"
2. Team was curious about the tech stack (11 Labs, GPT-4.5.1, Vapi)
3. The interplay between UI and voice was noted as sophisticated
4. Interest in exploring the voice technology for their own products

## Current Recruiting Setup
- Never use recruiters traditionally
- Have had bad experiences with AI recruiting tools in the past (bait and switch with AI speaking to prospects)
- Currently doing hiring themselves

## Competition
Internal hiring efforts. They just extended an offer that fell through and are processing remaining pipeline.

## Next Steps
1. Edmund to follow up next week (after Jan 16 holiday period)
2. If current candidates don't work out, they'll proceed with Superposition
3. Adam already completed partial onboarding - can resume where left off
4. Edmund offered to geek out about voice AI building with Adam

## Onboarding Status
- **Discussed**: Yes - live demo conducted
- **Partial Onboarding**: Adam completed about 50% of voice onboarding during the call
- **Scheduled Date**: To be scheduled next week pending their current hiring process

## Deal Temperature
**WARM** - High interest demonstrated through live demo participation. They're holding decision until current pipeline is exhausted (next few days), then will likely proceed. Also mentioned potential for Account Executive and Customer Success roles in future.
