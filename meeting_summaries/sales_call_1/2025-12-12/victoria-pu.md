- **Salary**: $182,000 - $250,000
- **Location**: Bay Area

## Discussion Summary
Victoria reached out via Gotti from Anti Gravity. Her company (federal contractor) is hiring a "unicorn" backend engineer combining big tech/games experience with scrappy startup experience. They're currently using Paraform (not fully satisfied) plus contingency recruiters. Edmund walked through Superposition's agent-first approach, 10% success fee structure, and how the agent handles nuanced requirements like the visa sponsorship constraint. Victoria was very impressed and provided valuable product feedback about wanting to upload sample profiles and helping with candidate closing.

## Key Product Feedback
1. **Sample profiles**: Wants to upload example yes/no candidates for calibration (Edmund: on roadmap)
2. **Candidate closing**: Human recruiters are better at closing - Paraform fell short here. Victoria suggested baking in company mission/selling points into outreach
3. **Context for closing**: Would love agent to surface candidate context (what resonated with them) to help close offers

## Current Recruiting Setup
- Victoria: Resume screening, 20-30 min intro calls
- ML Lead: Two technical rounds (leetcode + 2-hour system design)
- Final: On-site work simulation with Victoria + CPO/co-founder

## Competition
- Paraform (made 2 hires, not super satisfied - recruiters can't help close candidates)
- Individual contingency recruiters (better at closing)

## Next Steps
- **Onboarding call scheduled**: Monday December 16, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET
- Edmund to send calendar invite

## Onboarding Status
- **Discussed**: Yes
- **Scheduled Date**: Monday December 16, 2025 at 4:00 PM ET

## Deal Temperature
**HOT** - Very interested, already scheduled onboarding, potential to become default recruiting solution for multiple hires over next 6-8 months.
