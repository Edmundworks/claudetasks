# Customer Call Summary: Plastic Labs

## Meeting Details
- **Company**: Plastic Labs
- **Contact**: Courtland Leer (courtland@plasticlabs.ai)
- **Meeting Date**: 2026-01-14
- **Granola URL**: https://granola.ai/note/72af74a2-09da-4718-8d6b-a61c7acea6cb

## Current Status with Superposition
- Active customer piloting founding salesperson search
- Previously discussed Head of Sales role, now refined to Junior AE/SDR hybrid

## Key Discussion Points

### Role Refinement
1. **Original Brief**: Head of Sales
2. **Revised Brief**: Junior AE (with SDR/BDR responsibilities)
   - Title is "Junior AE" to make it sexier and show promotion path
   - Actual day-to-day is SDR work: prospecting, CRM building, cold outreach, pipeline management
   - Founders still leading sales calls initially
   - This person qualifies leads, founders close
   - Trigger for promotion to full AE: when conversions start happening

### Ideal Candidate Profile
1. **Experience Level**: Junior - someone who's been SDR for ~6 months and has another 6 months before natural promotion
2. **Background Sources**:
   - SDR programs/bootcamps
   - "Premier" shops like Oracle, EMC that consistently produce high performers
   - Performance matters more than pedigree
3. **Product Experience**:
   - B2B SaaS infrastructure positive
   - Dev tooling focus is extra credit (Vercel, Supabase type companies)
   - Not crucial they've sold similar product
4. **ICP Knowledge**:
   - Plastic Labs targets companions and coding agents (20-50x more token intensive than general assistants)
   - Target customers: ~100k MAU (4-6 customers = $1-2M ARR)
   - "Mid-market" in sales terminology (not "enterprise" in startup parlance)
5. **Startup Experience**: Not critical - most SDRs are at big companies anyway

### Compensation Model Discussed
- Base + variable comp
- Initial comp tied to qualified meetings
- Can also incentivize on % of first year spend
- Lower salary with on-target earnings

### Selling Points for Candidates
1. **Autonomy**: Build the GTM stack from scratch (no CSV of leads from rev ops)
2. **Tooling Ownership**: Get to pick tools (Clay, etc.) and influence custom tooling
3. **AI-native Team**: Can reverse engineer SaaS overnight with Claude Code
4. **Promotion Path**: Clear path to AE in 12 months if successful

## Issues/Concerns Raised
- None - role clarity has improved significantly
- Founders are now clearer on what they need vs what they thought they needed

## Satisfaction Level
- High - Courtland expressed readiness to start immediately
- Fundraising order of operations no longer a blocker for this hire

## Action Items / Follow-ups
1. **Superposition**: Get sales evals created with Aubrey (founding sales at Growth Central) to bootstrap agent taste
2. **Superposition**: Turn on agent by next week
3. **Superposition**: Experiment with both inbound and outbound for this role
4. **Superposition**: Once JD is signed off, aggregate across job boards for inbound
5. **Plastic Labs**: Be ready for candidate flow starting next week

## Next Steps
- Agent to start delivering pipeline next week
- Candidates flagged in Slack
- Volume assessment to determine best review workflow (Slack vs UI)

## Health Score: GREEN
- Strong engagement and clear requirements
- Customer is motivated and ready to move quickly
- Role refinement shows thoughtful iteration
- Positive relationship with founding team (met Drew, founding engineer)
