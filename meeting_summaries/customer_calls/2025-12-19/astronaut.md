## Call Purpose
Ayoola requested advice on closing a founding engineer candidate (Liana Novitz) who came through the Superposition pipeline and is currently in a 2-week work trial.

## Candidate Context
- **Candidate**: Liana Novitz
- **Current Role**: Nike (remote, Unity-related work)
- **Location**: Bay Area (East Bay)
- **Work Trial**: 2-week contract at $100/hour, ending Sunday
- **Motivation**: Wants to be an entrepreneur, feels stuck at Nike, sees this as learning opportunity
- **Side Project**: Open source recruitment-related project

## Edmund's Closing Advice

### Pre-Close Strategy
1. **Do discovery first** - Ask about their vision for themselves (5-6 year happy path)
2. **Ask what needs to remain true** about Astronaut for it to stay aligned with their career path
3. **Understand other processes** - Are they interviewing elsewhere?
4. **Social setting works** - Dinner, hiking (West Coast), builds relationship before numbers talk

### Compensation Discussion Approach
1. Ask about **equity vs cash mental model** first
2. Then ask: "What range does something need to be in for you to consider it?"
3. **Don't throw out an offer** in the social setting
4. Schedule a call for the next day to present the actual offer
5. If they negotiate up, don't capitulate immediately - say you need to check with advisor, call back in 30 mins

### Benchmark Data Shared
Recent founding engineer offers (pre-seed/seed stage):
- Superposition (NYC, $1.6M raised): $150K + 1.5%, $170K + 1%
- SF Role 1 (2 weeks ago): $170K + 1.25%
- SF Role 2 (3 weeks ago): $175K + 1.5%
- **Consensus**: ~$170K + 1% is the market rate for founding engineers

### Selling Equity
- **DON'T** try to project future value with spreadsheets - it's a losing game
- **DO** explain why you're an outlier vs other pre-seed companies
- Let them sell the equity upside to themselves via internet research
- If asked about valuation, explain the cap is "a price from when we raised, not a valuation"

### Contract Rate Anchoring
- $100/hr contract rate anchors in the right order of magnitude
- Contract rate assumes 40 hours, but startup work is more - so it's not as high as it seems

## Ayoola's Timeline
- **Sunday**: Pre-close conversation (work trial ends)
- **Monday**: Present formal offer
- **Tuesday**: Contingency day for questions before she returns to Nike

## Astronaut Company Context
- Raised $3.1M (has spent a decent amount)
- Solo founder (had co-founder breakup)
- Currently rolling off underperforming engineer
- Liana's work trial going well, likely to make offer
- Just closed an enterprise deal (Houston-based)
- Needs 2 engineers total

## Future Hiring Needs Discussed

### Non-Technical Role
- Chief of Staff or Ops Manager or Business Analyst
- Needed for enterprise customer success/project management
- Superposition interested in being design partner for this role type

### QA Role
- Ayoola looking for QA to increase engineering velocity
- Wants someone to test user experience end-to-end
- Edmund recommended **Roboflow Moment** - AI-powered testing tool
- Key insight: Don't hire people you don't need if software can do it

## Action Items
1. Ayoola to do pre-close on Sunday, offer on Monday/Tuesday
2. Film video testimonial when Edmund and Ayoola are in same city
3. Explore Chief of Staff role design partnership in Q1
4. Ayoola to check out Roboflow Moment for QA automation

## Account Health
**GREEN** - Active customer, very satisfied with Superposition ("Edmund gives me so much leverage"). Enterprise customer closed in Houston. Strong relationship with product feedback loop.

## Notable Quotes
- "The fact that I literally, like, I'm working with someone off, like an agent is just incredible"
- "Edmund gives me so much leverage. It's insane."
