## Call Purpose
Customer check-in with Aristotle (True Ventures portfolio company). Shan shared product feedback and updated hiring requirements.

## Discussion Summary

Edmund opened by sharing Superposition's progress - they've hired two founding engineers (Drew and Uma) in the last few weeks. Drew pulled out of onsites at Ramp and Palantir to join, and Uma previously lived off hackathon winnings before getting a visa. The team is now at 4 people (Edmund, Li, and two engineers).

Shan provided strong testimonial feedback on Superposition. They tried multiple AI recruiters in November including Contrario (30% fee + subscription), Liftoff.xyz, Juicebox, Tezi, Noon AI, and Aria (YC company). Superposition was the only one they kept. **Key differentiator: Slack integration.** Shan emphasized that seeing candidates appear directly in Slack and being able to give feedback without logging into a separate portal was "unbeatable." Noon AI had a clean demo but required logging into a separate interface, which created friction and Shan forgot about it.

Competitive intel: Contrario charges subscription + 30% and outsources to recruitment agencies (it's "a marketplace of recruitment agencies"). Tezi wanted upfront subscription commitment. Most competitors told Aristotle they'd be "one of a thousand fighting over the same candidates."

Aristotle has 16 candidates in backlog awaiting review. Edmund walked through the new UI features including the Kanban pipeline view, assessment reasoning, and activity trace showing actual candidate messages. Shan requested: (1) less verbose assessment text - more like how people actually talk, not resume-speak, (2) personal websites/GitHub visible on cards, (3) ability to see candidate response messages without clicking into activity trace.

**Key requirement change**: Aristotle now wants younger engineers (<5 years experience) for founding hires. Their reasoning: first-time founders feel more comfortable managing peers vs. someone with 12+ years experience. They want AI-native candidates who can help build the engineering culture before layering on senior hires. Edmund offered to manually curate the backlog to filter by experience.

## Feedback / Issues
1. Assessment text too verbose/resume-like - needs to be more conversational
2. Want to see personal websites prominently displayed on candidate cards
3. GitHub profile data should be more visually accessible (not just in reasoning)
4. Would benefit from seeing candidate enthusiasm/response content surfaced in main view

## Current Hiring Needs
1. **1-2 more engineers** - same profile, but <5 years experience, younger, AI-native
2. **1 designer** - younger, high agency, between graphic/product design, design sense matters more than Figma skills
3. **Generalist ops/growth person** - chief of staff type, performance marketing, could be VC analyst, IB 2nd year, PM, or growth role background

## Action Items
- Edmund to manually curate the 16-candidate backlog, filtering for <5 years experience
- Ping Shan when curation is complete so he can review and provide feedback
- Aristotle to put updated requirements in Slack (agent will pick up automatically)

## Product Roadmap Shared
- Sales roles launching end of Q1
- Ops/generalist roles coming after sales
- Design/product roles after ops

## Account Health
**GREEN** - Strong advocate, actively using product, provided excellent testimonial content and competitive intel. Only friction is backlog review volume which new UI features should address.
