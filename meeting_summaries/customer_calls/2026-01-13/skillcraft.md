- **Meeting Date**: 2026-01-13
- **Granola URL**: https://granola.ai/note/cb0ffdc5-9909-4618-a49d-d2abb04d424c

## Current Status with Superposition
- Active customer with Design Engineer search
- Had been blocked/inactive due to being "unbelievably busy"
- Recently hired 3 people (tripled team in 12 days)
- CTO (Poly) has access issues (Clerk auth bug creating orphaned duplicate)

## Key Discussion Points

### Technical Issues
1. **Auth Bug**: CTO Poly can't access platform - orphaned duplicate Skillcraft org created
   - Edmund to fix on backend and resend invite today

### Product Feedback - Critical UX Insights
1. **Backlog Overwhelm**: "It feels like I'm already bankrupt, so why even bother"
   - Slack notifications created feeling of insurmountable backlog
   - Didn't understand what was happening initially when agent turned on

2. **Candidate Comparison Need**:
   - Wants to compare candidates side-by-side
   - Currently clicks between LinkedIn profiles to build mental models
   - Stack ranking would help determine where to draw the line

3. **Notification Preferences**:
   - Daily/weekly rollup preferred over individual pings
   - Would go to platform to review, not do work in Slack
   - "Slack notifications that aren't communication feel like distraction"

4. **Sorting/Prioritization**:
   - No sorting feature currently - needs agent to rank "top 4 to start with"
   - Blank page fear is the hardest hurdle
   - Would review top recommendations first, then decide if need to retune

### Role Evolution
- **Original**: Design Engineer (artistic focus)
- **Updated**: Implementation support for production
   - Now have hired a product designer separately
   - Need someone to translate design inspiration into production speedily
   - Less artistic, more: "loves AI tools, delights customers through interaction design"
   - Multimodal experience, voice tech solutioning
   - Software engineering fundamentals
   - Can take Lovable prototypes to production-ready code

### Features Walkthrough
- Explained AI valuation vs Ideal Candidate Profile
- Showed calibration settings (hard requirements, ideal candidate profile, agent learning)
- Agent learning now shows inferred preferences from feedback (shipped yesterday)
- Discussed upcoming voice input feature for reviewing candidates

## Issues/Concerns Raised
1. **Activation Blocker**: Overwhelmed by notification volume and backlog
2. **CTO Access**: Auth bug preventing Poly from joining
3. **No Sorting**: Can't easily identify best candidates to start with
4. **Mental Model Gap**: Didn't fully understand the flow initially

## Satisfaction Level
- Moderate - Ready to be activated but has been blocked
- Good product sensibilities and engaged in feedback
- Appreciates building for builders

## Action Items / Follow-ups
1. **Superposition (Edmund)**: Fix Poly's access issue and resend invite today
2. **Superposition (Edmund)**: Manually curate shortlist of top candidates tonight
   - Create "Extra Shortlist" column
   - Pick top candidates based on Skillcraft context
3. **Superposition**: Batch notifications every other day (default)
4. **Superposition**: Build "breakthrough" notifications for exceptionally good fits
5. **Superposition**: Implement candidate sorting/ranking
6. **Skillcraft**: Review shortlisted candidates once Edmund curates

## Key Product Insights for Roadmap
- Notification cadence: batch by default, breakthrough for exceptional
- Stack ranking candidates is critical for activation
- Blank page fear is real blocker
- Platform > Slack for actual review work
- Voice input could be valuable but sorting is higher priority

## Next Steps
- Edmund to manually shortlist candidates tonight
- Clear backlog and get agent running properly
- Resume candidate flow once activated

## Health Score: YELLOW
- Customer has been blocked/inactive due to UX friction
- Not a product quality issue, but activation/onboarding gap
- High potential once unblocked - good product feedback
- Recently busy with other hires (tripled team)
- Needs manual intervention to clear backlog and re-engage
