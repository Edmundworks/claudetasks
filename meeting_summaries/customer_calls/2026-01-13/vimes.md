- **Granola URL**: https://granola.ai/note/6f2dd031-4e13-475e-b06c-1eb1b9f441c6

## Current Status with Superposition
- Active customer running engineering search
- ~15% interview rate on candidates surfaced
- Also piloting non-technical hire (Head of Sales/Customer Success for government tech)

## Key Discussion Points

### Current Engineering Pipeline Feedback
1. **Interview Rate**: 15% (confirmed accurate against data)
2. **Quality of Interviews**: Only 1-2 have been impressive out of those interviewed
3. **Success Story**: Ezra Steutzel was exceptional (distributed systems background)
4. **Issues Identified**:
   - Some candidates require work visa sponsorship (should be filtered out)
   - A few candidates re-engaged after already being closed (timing lag)
   - Cold email template needed manual correction initially
   - Some candidates had no resume/LinkedIn (just 4 bullet points)

### Feature Requests / Improvements Needed
1. **Pre-screening Question**: Add requirement check for willingness to travel on-site (1-2 weeks/month) - role involves forward deployment
2. **Sponsorship Filter**: Make US Citizen or Permanent Resident a requirement
3. **Stage Sync**: Fix lag in candidate stage updates
4. **Resume Handling**: 90-95% have LinkedIn/resume; for the few without, flag differently

### New Role: Head of Sales/Customer Success (Government Tech)
**Target Profile**:
- State and local government sales experience (NOT federal)
- Law enforcement tech, EdTech, GovTech (municipalities) all relevant
- Examples given: Milo Danny (former Head of Sales at Pair, VP BD at Mark43), Wilken (Director of Sales at YC company, Sales Director at Mark43)
- Estimated <50 candidates in country fit this profile
- Seniority: Director+ preferred but not required

**ICP for this role's sales**:
- Chief of Police, Sheriff, Director of Child Welfare
- City CSO, Mayor, Nonprofit Director, School Superintendent
- Need both decision maker AND internal champion (2-3 levels down)

**Process Request**: Pre-approve candidates before outbound (high stakes headhunting)

### Ashby Integration

- Superposition to integrate and review existing backlog
- Will create service user in Ashby for agent access
- **Follow-up Meeting**: 5pm tomorrow (Jan 14) to set up Ashby integration

### Hiring Process Insights Shared
- Edmund shared Superposition's founding engineer hiring process
- 41 first stage interviews -> 5 onsites -> 2 offers -> 2 accepts
- Key insight: Founders made decisions without discussing between stages (reduced friction)
- Technical screen focused on "how they build" (agent-pilled workflow discussion)
- On-site included dinner night before and after

2. Need better filtering on sponsorship requirements
