## Key Activities Completed

### 1. Email Template Review
- Van requested two variants: mission-focused and engineering-focused
- Wanted templates to match the tone of his job description (confident, direct, no-nonsense)
- Preferred "slightly softened" tone rather than sharp
- System had issues with broad rewrite instructions - needed granular edits
- **Outcome**: Skipped to candidate review; email template to be refined async

### 2. Candidate Review (10 candidates reviewed)
| Candidate | Company/Background | Decision | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| Ease | Staff Eng @ Ribbon Health | Maybe | Interesting but too senior (20+ yrs) |
| Bill Kaushoy | Senior Eng, NY | Maybe | Would want more startup background |
| Greg Borelli | Lead Eng @ New Relic | No | Enterprise-tilted, wouldn't screen |
| Juan Delgado | Co-founder, 4 years | **Yes** | Clearest early-stage signal |
| Z Wang | Datadog, ex-Foursquare | **Yes** | 4-year stretch shows commitment |
| Demi Olagoki | Tinder (5 years) | No | Too safe, wants startup experience |
| Brett Smenteck | Coinbase/Peloton/Casper/Luminary | No | Luminary relevant but not early-stage enough |
| Arjun Adia | Amazon/AWS | **Yes** | Despite big company background |
| Roly Fentanes | Google/Palantir/Perdata | **Yes** | Strong pedigree |
| Derek Brands | Staff @ Consensus, ex-Google | Reviewed | (Final candidate) |

**Final tally**: 4 candidates moving forward out of 10 reviewed

### 3. Calibration Feedback
- **No to FAANG**: Doesn't want long FAANG tenure (short stints OK if left for startups)
- **Preferred companies**: Datadog, Palantir, similar tier
- **Wants**: Startup experience, not "too safe" profiles

### 4. Slack Integration
- Attempted to set up Slack integration
- Browser became unresponsive - to be completed async

## Product Feedback from Van

> "I think it's a little wordy. When you're speaking to a person, their ability to understand context and not reiterate it back to you so frequently is useful. It definitely is a drawn out experience."

**Key issue**: Agent talks back too much, reiterates context unnecessarily
