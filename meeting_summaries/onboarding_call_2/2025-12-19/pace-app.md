### Technical Requirements

### Positive Signals
- Traditional CS background from reputable institutions
- Big tech experience (Uber, Airbnb, DoorDash) + smaller company experience
- Python proficiency
- IIT or top engineering schools
- Experience at high-bar companies (Anthropic, Coinbase)

2. **Live Coding** (1 hour) - with ML Lead, single LeetCode problem in Python, focus on problem-solving and CS fundamentals
3. **System Design** (2 hours) - with ML Lead, end-to-end system design mirroring day-to-day work (1hr high-level design + 1hr implementation)
4. **Behavioral On-site** (1 hour) - with CPO/co-founder, behavioral evaluation + work simulation + meet the team

## Candidate Review Highlights
Victoria reviewed 9 candidates during the session:

| Candidate | Company Background | Decision | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| Patrick Willett | Uber → Trunk | **FIT** | Strong backend architecture, smaller company validates end-to-end. Confirm Python. |
| William Huang | Cointracker | Pass | Python not primary language |
| Zhaofan (Ami) | Data/Platform | Pass | Too infra-heavy, not feature engineering |
| Andrew Sedna | JPMorgan | Pass | Legacy tech background - strong negative signal |
| Miles Source | Coinbase/TikTok | Pass | Not senior enough, non-CS undergrad |
| Hongdaeng | Airbnb/Sift | **FIT** | Traditional CS, Airbnb experience. Verify if building customer-facing features. |
| Alexander Dementov | Google + AI startups | Pass | Contract relationships with big tech, Java not Python |
| Santosh Banda | Meta/DoorDash | **FIT** | DoorDash tech lead signal earned conversation despite Meta tenure |
| Kushal Thacker | Anthropic/Meta | **Maybe** | IIT + Anthropic high bar, but research/infra heavy. Only if pivoting to applied work. |
