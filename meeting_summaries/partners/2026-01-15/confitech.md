## Discussion Summary
Eugen and Viktor from Confitech (German recruitment agency) discussed formalizing a referral partnership for their US tech startup clients. They have multiple high-salary roles ($200-300k) at startups in NYC, SF, and LA that they struggle to fill with their manual EU-based recruiting approach.

Edmund walked them through the full Superposition pitch - voice agent onboarding, deep reasoning over candidates, GitHub analysis, continuous sourcing. Key selling points: not a tool for recruiters but "the recruiter itself", high taste matching, 6-week average time-to-fill.

Confitech wants to position themselves to clients as having AI-powered sourcing capabilities through this partnership. They'll send first contract draft and identify a pilot customer. Edmund will create a Notion doc with talk tracks and scheduling link.

## Key Product Feedback
1. Requested demo access / presentation materials - Edmund declined (prefers live walk-throughs, avoids version control issues)
2. Want Notion page with "how to talk about it" talk tracks
3. Interested in being on first onboarding calls to see product in action

## Next Steps
| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Send partnership contract draft | Confitech | This week |
| Create Notion partner page with talk tracks | Edmund | After contract |
| Create dedicated scheduling link for attribution | Edmund | After contract |
| Set up shared Slack channel (add Lee) | Edmund | After contract signed |
| Identify first pilot customer | Confitech | ASAP |
| Schedule first joint onboarding (both parties on call) | Both | After first lead converts |

## Partnership Temperature
**WARM** - Genuine alignment on ICP (US tech startups without HR), strong commercial interest (multiple active roles), and Eugen has partnership background (understands mechanics). Main risk is they're new to US market and execution will determine actual lead flow.
