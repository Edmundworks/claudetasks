## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

### Email Volume Analysis:
- **High noise ratio today:** ~26% of emails were auto-archivable notifications
- **Customer communications:** Strong activity with Traba, Resolvd, Valley onboardings/partnerships
- **Fundraising:** Ardent SAFE completed successfully
- **Sales outreach:** Multiple persistent vendors (Rho, recruiting services)

### Key Patterns:
- **Valley launch:** Zayd very engaged, offering product access and demos
- **Onboarding momentum:** Two customer onboardings scheduled this week (Traba, Resolvd)
- **Tax compliance:** Time-sensitive Gusto tax form distribution deadline

### Skepticism Applied:
- ✅ Correctly identified recruiting vendors despite "opportunity" framing
- ✅ Distinguished between genuine customer conversations vs sales pitches
- ✅ Avoided excitement over marketing campaigns with big names
