# Yesterday's Meetings - 2025-10-22

## 30 Min Call with Edmund between Edmund Cuthbert and Ben Ellman
**Time**: 10:03
**Participants**: Edmund Cuthbert, Ben Ellman

### Action Items:
- [ ] Send Loom demo of investor intro tool; include upload instructions for investor tracker and request feedback — Owner: Edmund — Deadline: ASAP
- [ ] Share recommended VC list and make warm intros (after receiving Ben’s target list; also send a few proactive suggestions) — Owner: Edmund — Deadline: ASAP
- [ ] If async walkthrough via Loom isn’t sufficient, schedule a follow-up call for a live walkthrough — Owner: Edmund — Deadline: If needed

### Key Decisions:
- Treat VC process like a multi-threaded enterprise sale; identify champion vs. partner objections explicitly.
- Do broad top-of-funnel outreach; filter at the end once there’s momentum.
- Frame positioning with generalized VCs (avoid narrow PropTech prior biases).

**Time**: 13:07
**Participants**: Edmund Cuthbert, Andela team (names referenced in transcript), Lee (Superposition)

### Action Items:
- [ ] Prioritize candidates with deep Rails, React, and TypeScript full‑stack experience (IC focus); de‑prioritize ML‑heavy profiles — Owner: Edmund/Team — Deadline: Ongoing
- [ ] Enforce US‑only candidates and strengthen fake‑candidate detection (multi‑source verification across LinkedIn/GitHub/email signals) — Owner: Edmund/Xiang — Deadline: This week
- [ ] Add a final reconfirmation step before running searches when inputs straddle disciplines (e.g., ML vs. full‑stack) — Owner: Edmund/Xiang — Deadline: This week
- [ ] Surface core tech stack signals more prominently at the top of candidate profiles — Owner: Edmund/Xiang — Deadline: This week
- [ ] Schedule follow‑up call to review initial search results — Owner: Edmund — Deadline: 2025-10-23

### Key Decisions:
- Completed 10‑candidate voice calibration; system should now remember preferences for this role.
- Andela to review LinkedIn/GitHub links directly; Superposition to improve stack signal surfacing.
- Follow‑up meeting set for “tomorrow” (i.e., 2025‑10‑23) to assess run quality.

## 15 Min Call with Superposition between Edmund Cuthbert and Kamil
**Time**: 14:46
**Participants**: Edmund Cuthbert, Kamil

### Action Items:
- [ ] Ping Kamil to confirm go/no‑go and next steps — Owner: Edmund — Deadline: 2025-10-23 (today)
- [ ] If go: purchase and start warming domains (or use house domains once available); ramp outreach volume gradually — Owner: Edmund/Team — Deadline: Start immediately upon approval
- [ ] Schedule a 45‑minute onboarding session for agent calibration and messaging sign‑off — Owner: Edmund — Deadline: When proceeding
- [ ] Explore/implement “house domains” capability to remove friction for founders — Owner: Edmund/Xiang — Deadline: This week

### Key Decisions:
- Email deliverability and domain warming are the primary blockers; willingness to proceed if handled by Superposition without using founder’s main domain.
- Onboarding process: 45‑minute agent interview + low‑volume ramp with Slack handoff for qualified candidates.
